SWITCH THE README TO CODE!!!!!! Compiled with visual studio using c#. Make sure to add:
  "<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Soulseek" Version="8.5.0" />
  </ItemGroup>
  in your cs.proj after 
    </PropertyGroup>
    and before
    </Project>"
Also the quickest way to make a string table values using your playilist is to make a long screenshoot and give it to some ai and tell it to list only your song titles without numbering them and tell him to make that into a c# string table
